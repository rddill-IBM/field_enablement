2363068,Credit card,GLOBEX,02-28-2017,IL,I applied in branch for the Globex Card. I was informed by the banker that I would be eligible for the  in branch offer  of XXXX Thank You points and -$350.00- annual fee as opposed to the online offer of XXXX Thank You points and -$450.00- annual fee. For this reason I decided to apply. Upon satisfying the sign up requirements I noticed that my account was only credited XXXX Thank You points and my annual fee ended up being -$450.00- ( similar to the online offer ). Turns out that after a quick google search that the in-branch offer was only available if you signed up for a checking account as well however I was not informed this in branch. If I had known that this was the case I would nt have applied for the card to begin with. I spoke to Globex a few months ago about my complaint but they were unable to offer a compromise. I am still very upset about this and frankly I feel cheated - I only just found about CFPB and figured that I would document my story here so that others do nt make the same mistake that I did.
2803436,Credit card or prepaid card,SOYLENT,02-04-2018,OR,In XX/XX/XXXX I obtained an Soylent  credit card with a 15 month introductory 0 % APR interest rate for balance transfers and all purchases. I transferred a balance of -$3700.00- from another card which went through on XX/XX/XXXX. I also used the card to make one purchase on XX/XX/XXXX for -$87.00-. When I received my first billing statement I was dismayed to see I was being charged -$36.00- in interest for allegedly -$1800.00- in purchases under  Balance Subject to Interest Rate   Purchases  in the  Interest Charge Calculation  section on the billing statement. My balance transfer of was also erroneously listed in that section under  Balance Subject to Interest Rate  as -$56.00- instead of the actual amount of -$3700.00-. These numbers are erroneous in numerous ways : they dont add up with the purchase I made ( there are not -$1800.00- in purchases itemized on the statement only the one for -$87.00- ) none  of my purchases should be charged interest until after the introductory period is up on XX/XX/XXXX and the incorrect balance transfer amount listed in the  Interest Charge Calculation  section. These are random amounts without any reason behind them. I contacted Soylent  customer service after viewing this statement to ask why I was being charged interest during the introductory rate period and the random amounts listed on my statement. I was told this was definitely a billing mistake on their end and they would fix it. I felt this would get taken care of and would be reversed on my next billing statement. I then viewed the XX/XX/XXXX billing statement where not only was nothing fixed or reversed but I was being charged -$98.00- in interest for  Purchases  of -$3800.00-. My statement lists -$390.00- in itemized purchases during that period. The balance transfer amount is now listed as -$110.00- and my  Introductory Purchase  amount is -$110.00-. Again completely random amounts that dont make sense. I called their customer service line once again and was told they were  aware of the issue  with my account and my account was  heavily notated  and they were  working on it . Feeling less optimistic about a resolution I decided to stop using my Soylent card for any more purchases. Now after viewing my XX/XX/XXXX billing statement I see once again nothing has been fixed or credited to my account ( assuming my payments are going first towards the erroneously charged interest instead of the principal ) and Im still being charged interest for  purchase  amounts I did not make which is -$83.00- for allegedly -$3800.00- in purchases not itemized on the statement. I have decided to take the step of filing a complaint with the CFPB at this point because I feel the company has had plenty of time to fix this issue going back to XX/XX/XXXX and doesnt care they are committing consumer fraud by refusing to fix their billing issues. In summary I have been charged -$130.00- in interest from XX/XX/XXXX and -$83.00- so far in XX/XX/XXXX for a total of -$210.00- I should not have been charged per the 0 % interest for 15 months agreement I signed up for.
3117038,Checking or savings account,GLOBEX,01-04-2019,CA,Inquiry XXXX I received a promotional offer to open a Globex Priority bank account and after 2 criterion had been met would receive XXXX Thank You points. I have a credit account with Globexbank and the two requirements ( spending -$750.00- and setting up 2 months of autopay for a bill within 60 days ) seemed easy to meet so I decided to give it a try and move a small amount of funds to open an account. From day one there were problems -- first my opening deposit received an error message online so I called in to make sure it wasnt processed. The customer rep told me they were sure it had not been and that I could try again. When I made a second attempt that seemed to work I shortly after ( the next day ) received a notice from my bank that there were 2 transactions initiated. I attempted to cancel one and somehow this disrupted Globexbank s delicate and outdated system and caused my account to have a negative balance before I had even had it functioning for two days! I waited almost a week for this to be cleared up. I then changed an autopay of mine to come out of my new city account. At the end of the first month the bill came out and I had spent the -$750.00- required. I called customer service to confirm this and they told me that they could not confirm I had met the requirements but informed me that it was not as simple as setting up and auto pay  you have to add payees . Let me point out very strongly this was NOT what the promotional card said. It did not explain the  setting up payees  is what is required to meet the autopay requirement. At this point I knew that Globexbank would attempt not to award the Thank You points I had earned. I set up my aforementioned autopay as a  payee  and designated that -$100.00- be paid monthly -- this setup was done WELL within the two months. If conversations are recorded then Globexbank has evidence of all this via my conversations with the customer service representative. I opened an inquiry about a week ago in my local branch regarding this and received a letter from Globexbank dated XX/XX/28 stating that I did not meet their very cleverly vague  bill pay  requirements. I did meet these requirements even though I had to do my own digging and clarify the promotional card with the representative to do so. I insist on being awarded my Thank You points in entirety. I am extremely thankful I did not transfer more than a tiny amount of my funds and assets to Globexbank s care as I see they are very dishonest. I will make sure my dealings with their  promotions  are seen on social media and I will most definitely warn all of my acquaintances both business and otherwise of how I was scammed by Globexbank.
1419347,Mortgage,GLOBEX,06-12-2015,SC,We have had an extremely difficult time with our mortgage company GlobexMortgage. They have given us the runaround they have violated our consumer rights and they have engaged in illegal activities that may result in the wrongful foreclosure of our home. We are very concerned that GlobexMortgage is intentionally trying to force me to give up so they can foreclose on my home of XXXX years. We have been in foreclosure for over XXXX years. GlobexMortgage has cost me over -$5000.00- in Lawyer s fees which part of that -$5000.00- included my vehicle title being put up as collateral and us having to pay -$210.00- on a monthly basis to keep from losing it and another title loan on my other vehicle of -$250.00- a month adding to my monthly expense s along with my regular monthly expenses. Just so happens both of these extra expenses included in our budget also happens to be the dollar amount GlobexMortgage claims is the amount which disqualifies us from getting a modification on our home. We have been doing everything in our power to make this right with our lender but they are just unwilling to work with us. So we are requesting a review into GlobexMortgage s questionable tactics as listed below : Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) Regulation X Violation DGlobexMortgage has violated the Mortgage Servicing Rule 12 C.F.R. pt. 1024.41 subpart c. GlobexMortgage failed to comply with Loss Mitigation Procedures. GlobexMortgage exceeded the XXXX day time line to review my complete application. In fact the constant mishandling of our account perpetuated GlobexMortgage s excessive delays. While continuously requesting us to send them the same documents over and over again claiming they did nt receive them. Even after being denied we still received letters requesting some of the same documents we already sent during the modification process. They clearly do not have their priorities in order to control their business so how can I trust them to have their priorities in order to properly handle my modification. GlobexMortgage wrongfully denied me due to insufficient income. RESPA 12 CFR Chapter X Part 1024.41- Dual Tracking 1024.41 ( g ) the servicer is restricted from moving  forward with foreclosure while simultaneously working with the borrower to avoid foreclosure . GlobexMortgage has blatantly engaged in dual tracking. In XXXX of2010 we received a foreclosure notice from GlobexMortgage. This caught us by surprise because we were previously in review for a loan modification. I called GlobexMortgage to get to the bottom of this and they confirmed that ourAccount was still active and under review for a loan modification. Why was GlobexMortgage moving forward with the foreclosure? GlobexMortgage has repeatedly violated Section 5 of the FTC act - prohibits  unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce  -Cause or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers- Can not be reasonably avoided by consumersI am now concerned that GlobexMortgage has prepared and executed false and misleading documents with the courts and government agencies as part of the foreclosure process. I am requesting a copy of all documentation associated to the processing of the foreclosure of our home. GlobexMortgage s failure as a servicer is absolutely egregious and it has caused great harm and injury to my family and me. GlobexMortgage s illegal practice is putting my family at risk of becoming homeless due to no fault of our own. We want to refer our complaint to the Consumer Financial ProtectionBureau The Federal Trade Commission the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Department of Justice to issue a ruling on GlobexMortgage s continued violation.
2544267,Credit card or prepaid card,GLOBEX,06-09-2017,TX,On  X/XX/2017    I applied for  a Globex Double Cash cred it card and was approved. On  XX/XX/XXXX  I received a voicemail from someone claiming to be  the Globex fraud  department stating my card had been stolen and I needed to return their call ; however when I Googled the number that called me it said it was a scam and not to call the number back. At this point I still had not received my card or been able to activate it. I finally received my card in the mail on  XX/XX/XXXX and attempted to activate it on  XX/XX/XXXX . When speaking with the  Globex represen tative she requested I give her my cell phone number so they could send me a text to confirm it was me ; however she stated the text message would not go through and requested another number I gave her my husbands cell phone number which also could not go through. At this point she requested I give her another credit card number (  16  digit card number ) and the balance of the card I refused to provide this information because there are many other ways to confirm someone s identity. The representative did not give me any other options and would not get a supervisor to assist me in opening my card. I have called at least 5 times in the pa st two days to t ry and speak to someone who will assist me in opening the card and immediately closing it. Every time I call they tell me that a supervisor will call me in  24 hours ; however it has been over 24 hours since I called and I have not received anything. It is beyond frustrating to deal with Globex and all I want to do is close the card.
2118849,Bank account or service,GLOBEX,09-20-2016,CA,Globexbank atm took my money without depositing in my account and only paid me back a portion of the funds. The branch is giving me the run around after claiming fault.

2875382,Checking or savings account,GLOBEX,04-14-2018,FL,I contacted Globexbank to file a dispute on charges debited from my account by XXXX XXXX in XXXX Florida. I conducted business with this company over the telephone for credit repair services. The company did not do anything to repair my credit more than 90 days passed from the time I paid the company and nothing was done on their behalf to assist me with the credit repair services they promised. I contacted Globexbank on XX/XX/XXXX and filed a dispute for the charge of -$300.00- debited from my account on XX/XX/XXXX and for -$500.00- debited on XX/XX/XXXX. I reached out to XXXX XXXX and the individual I spoke to told me they were not going to refund my money even though they have not provided the services they promised for -$800.00-. I decided to contact my bank fro assistance. Globexbank denied my claim on XX/XX/XXXX based on the fact that the information I provided was not enough to support my claim. I did business over the phone with this scammers that fraudulently stole my hard earn money. I did business over the phone with the company off course I do not have anything from them to show to Globexbank I never signed any documents with this company I provided my information to them in good faith that they will deliver on their promise to assist me with credit repair in turn I get robed for my hard earned money and Globexbank allows that to happen I am their client. They are not taking care of my claim as a consumer.
2192246,Credit card,GLOBEX,11-02-2016,AZ,I moved to another state ; attempted to change address multiple times with Globex. I had not received a statement from Globex in over a year. I called multiple times to change my address. I could not reach a human being until I called on XXXX/XXXX/2016. I was told by this person my payment due had increased and I was now over my credit limit ( mind you I used the card one time for a promotional purpose when I opened this account ). Globex had charged multiple fees and penalties onto my account and had NEVER notified me of an issue. Upon calling in and finally getting a person to speak with ; Globex has refused to do anything other offer to waive XXXX interest charge and XXXX penalty fee. I believe Globex to be acting in a malicious manner towards consumers. Creating a maddening voice response system to cause confusion and near inability to speak with a live person not promptly updating address records and not contacting the consumer when there is an issue with the consumers account. Thus resulting in more ad more fees being added to the consumers account.
